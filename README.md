# Active Directory User Creation
This tool is to help deal with keeping up with entire user configurations for departments or gorups. Have you ever needed to keep a long list of all the departments or sub departments active directory configurations when creating a user in active directory?

## What does it do?
What it does is allow you to save all the fields from active directory you want to be static in your user configuration.

Once your config is saved you can make edits to your configs if anything changes.

Now that you have all your configurations set for all your future users to be created you can create the user with specifying the `User Name`, `Password` `First Name`, `Last Name`, then selecting the config you entered earlier.

## Usage
Make sure to run the app as administrator and also with a user with the proper permissions to create users in AD.

## Other notes
I am open to making this app better. I know its not the greatest thing to look at and if there is more functionallity added then submit a PR.
